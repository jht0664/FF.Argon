# Force Field and Topology of Argon
We use two force field of Argon as you can see two folders.

## FolderName & Comment
1. RNP: For liquid Argon, it works.

2. White: For gas Argon, it works. But liquid case is not good.
  * Original Paper: John A. White "Lennard-Jones as a model for argon and test of extended renormalization group calculations", Journal of Chemical Physics 111 pp. 9352-9356 (1999)
  * Reference Experimental Data: A. MICHELS, J. M. LEVELT and W. DE GRAAFF "COMPRESSIBILITY ISOTHERMS OF ARGON AT TEMPERATURES BETWEEN -- 25°C AND -- 155°C, AND AT DENSITIES UP TO 640 AMAGAT (PRESSURES UP TO 1050 ATMOSPHERES)", Physica XXIV, pp 659-671 (1958)
